# Batcher-Service 

## Background
I am proud to be a graduate of the first Wix-Kickstart program (Sept 2014) which is a 3 month web-development training for new employees at Wix.com LTD. As an enthusiastic educator, I returned a year later to the Wix Academy department (where the training took place) to run a one-day workshop about "Design Patterns in JS" for the Wix-Kickstart class of 2015. Even after I left Wix to start my Master studies, I volunteered to a day full of fun to instruct the same workshop to the class of 2016.

I am happy to share some of the hands-on exercises I designed for the workshop. Below are the main exercises, each of then in a pdf describing the requirements and goals of the exercise as well a link to outline for the solution\automatic testers. You are welcome to use those exercises, and if you find any issue with them, please let me know.

## Exercise specifications

In order to run the tests, open `project/SpecRunner.html` in you favorite browser. To rerun the tests - refresh the page.
